Count Lines, words, and characters in a file.
'''
import numpy as np

# Count line, word and charecter
# ---first method---
# loading the txt file in Python
# Loading 'testfile.txt' test file by using genfromtxt

testfile = np.genfromtxt('testfile.txt', dtype=None, delimiter=",")
print(testfile)

'''
To load the text file "Gettysburg_Address.txt". i tried to load the test file by using genfrom test but because of
special charecter 'รณ', it's fail to load in python. its happen if you bring file from different platform (operating system)
I tried hard but at the end, i decide to remove the special charecter 'รณ', easy method is copy the text file and past it in
new next file.
by using find and replace option from notepad, and save file as a 'Gettysburgtest.txt'
by using 'open' i am able to load the test file in python, 
'''
with open('Gettysburgtest.txt') as Gettysburg:
    textcontent = Gettysburg.readlines()
textcontent = [x.strip() for x in textcontent]
print(textcontent)
'''
--We can also load the 'testfile' as below:--
with open('testfile.txt') as testfile1:
    textcontent_testfile = testfile1.readlines()
textcontent_testfile = [x.strip() for x in textcontent_testfile]
print(textcontent_testfile)
'''

'''
So i writer a function, wich work pretty fine, if you load your text file as a list and if each line represent one element
in a list
'''


def count(data):
    total_line = 0
    count_word = 0
    total_char = 0
    for i in data:
        # print(i)
        x = i.split()
        # print(x)
        total_line = total_line + 1
        count_word = count_word + len(x)
        total_char = total_char + len(i) - (len(x) - 1)

    return total_line, count_word, total_char


# We are calling the function using testfile as input
line, word, charecter = count(testfile)
print("----The total line word and charecter of testfile is---- ")
print("Number of line in testfile =", line)
print("Number of word in testfile =", word)
print("Number of charecter in testfile =", charecter)

'''
We are calling the function for textcontent. when we run the function it can count line and word,
we did not clean the file after loading the file so when it count charecter it did not give the correct
result. So i try to find alternate method which can work more efficiently.
'''

line, word, charecter = count(textcontent)
print("----The total line and word of Gettysburg_Address is---- ")
print("Number of line =", line)
print("Number of word =", word)
#print("Number of charecter =", charecter)

'''
So I write python code again to count charecter properly for Gettysburg text
'''
aa = []
index = 0
for j in textcontent:
    aa.append([])
    for i in j:
        i.split()
        aa[index].append(i)
    index += 1
textcontent1 = aa
# print(textcontent1)
# print(len(textcontent1))

'''
Now I write a code to delete all character like empty space ' ', comma, full stop, '"' and other charecter which i listed below
'''
remove = {' ', '"', ',', '.', "!", "#", "$", "%", "&", "'", "(", ")", "*", "+", ",", "-", ".", "/", ":", ";", "<", "=", ">", "?", "@", "["}
#xa={' ', 'รณ',',','.','-', '"'}
a = []
index = 0
for j in textcontent1:
    a.append([])
    for i in j:
        if i not in remove:
            a[index].append(i)
    index += 1
newtextfile = a

# print(a)
# print(len(a))
'''
I modified my frist function to count the charecter.
'''


def charecter_count(data):
    total_line = 0
    total_char = 0
    for i in data:
        total_line = total_line + 1
        total_char = total_char + len(i)
    return total_line, total_char


line1, charecter1 = charecter_count(a)
print("----The total charecter of Gettysburg_Address is---- ")
print("Number of line =", line1)
#print("Number of word =", word1)
print("Number of charecter =", charecter1)
